The Fibonacci Sequence

The Fibonacci sequence appears in nature all around us, in the arrangement of seeds in a sunflower and the spiral of a nautilus for example.

The Fibonacci sequence begins with fibonacci(0) = 0 and fibonacci(1) = 1 as its first and second terms. 
After these first two elements, each subsequent element is equal to the sum of the previous two elements.

    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
n = int(input())
print(fibonacci(n))
